It contains 23,000 color images of cats and dogs (variable sizes).
I have tried to build a deeper CNN with data augmentation, dropout, and batch normalization to handle the complexity of real-world RGB images.
It has 6 conv layers, data augmentation, batch normalization, dropout, and early stopping. 
The model produced a Test accuracy: 0.8927
